    <h1>Driverbot Project Description</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>The "Driverbot" project has been a thrilling and educational journey, combining creativity, engineering, and programming. I designed and built LEGO cars that are controlled via this website, showcasing my passion for technology and innovation. I delved into CAD (Computer-Aided Design) to create and optimize specific components, ensuring precision and functionality. Throughout this process, I've not only expanded my technical skills but also had immense fun bringing my ideas to life. I invite you to explore my project and experience the joy of driving my LEGO car remotely!
